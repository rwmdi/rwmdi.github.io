I am a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering program at KAUST. 


Part of my role at university is being a **Teaching Assistant** for several courses offered for Master students, such as  **Stochastic Processes**,  **Digital Communication and Coding**, and  **Introduction to Programming With Python** courses.
