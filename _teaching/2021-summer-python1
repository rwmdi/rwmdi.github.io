My first teaching experince is for Introduction to Programming With Python (CS 201) course provided by the comuter science program at KAUST. 


During this offering, I worked with Dr. Malek Smaoui to help students from different programs learn programming skills using Python language and give practical techniques, tips, and technologies to build and maintain complex Python code effectively.
This teaching experince I used the learning management system (LMS) used at KAUST (i.e., BlackBoard). Additionally, as part of my tasks I graded coding assignments on LMS, held weekly recitiation sessions, and helped design homework assignment and exams.
