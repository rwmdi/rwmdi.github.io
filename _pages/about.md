I am a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering program at KAUST. I'm currently working in the communication theory lab abd information science lab with Prof. Mohamed-Slim Alouini and Prof. Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, respectively. 


During my years at KAUST, I enjoy working as a **Teaching Assistant** on the side for several courses offered for Master and Ph.D. students, such as  **Stochastic Processes**,  **Digital Communication and Coding**, **Advanced Wireless Communication Systems**, and  **Introduction to Programming With Python** courses.
